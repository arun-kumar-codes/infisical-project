```bash
infisical bootstrap --domain=<domain> --email=<email> --password=<password> --organization=<organization>
```

## Description

The `infisical bootstrap` command is used when deploying Infisical in automated environments where manual UI setup is not feasible. It's ideal for:

- Containerized deployments in Kubernetes or Docker environments
- Infrastructure-as-code pipelines with Terraform or similar tools
- Continuous deployment workflows
- DevOps automation scenarios

The command initializes a fresh Infisical instance by creating an admin user, organization, and instance admin machine identity, enabling subsequent programmatic configuration without human intervention.

<Warning>
  This command creates an instance admin machine identity with the highest level
  of privileges. The returned token should be treated with the utmost security,
  similar to a root credential. Unauthorized access to this token could
  compromise your entire Infisical instance.
</Warning>

## Flags

<Accordion title="--domain" defaultOpen="true">
  The URL of your Infisical instance. This can be set using the `INFISICAL_API_URL` environment variable.

```bash
# Example
infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com
```

This flag is required.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--email">
  Email address for the admin user account that will be created. This can be set using the `INFISICAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable.

```bash
# Example
infisical bootstrap --email=admin@example.com
```

This flag is required.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--password">
  Password for the admin user account. This can be set using the `INFISICAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.

```bash
# Example
infisical bootstrap --password=your-secure-password
```

This flag is required.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="--organization">
  Name of the organization that will be created within the instance. This can be set using the `INFISICAL_ADMIN_ORGANIZATION` environment variable.

```bash
# Example
infisical bootstrap --organization=your-org-name
```

This flag is required.

</Accordion>

## Response

The command returns a JSON response with details about the created user, organization, and machine identity:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "credentials": {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZGVudGl0eUlkIjoiZGIyMjQ3OTItZWQxOC00Mjc3LTlkYWUtNTdlNzUyMzE1ODU0IiwiaWRlbnRpdHlBY2Nlc3NUb2tlbklkIjoiZmVkZmZmMGEtYmU3Yy00NjViLWEwZWEtZjM5OTNjMTg4OGRlIiwiYXV0aFRva2VuVHlwZSI6ImlkZW50aXR5QWNjZXNzVG9rZW4iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDIzMjI0ODl9.mqcZZqIFqER1e9ubrQXp8FbzGYi8nqqZwfMvz09g-8Y"
    },
    "id": "db224792-ed18-4277-9dae-57e752315854",
    "name": "Instance Admin Identity"
  },
  "message": "Successfully bootstrapped instance",
  "organization": {
    "id": "b56bece0-42f5-4262-b25e-be7bf5f84957",
    "name": "dog",
    "slug": "dog-v-e5l"
  },
  "user": {
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "firstName": "Admin",
    "id": "a418f355-c8da-453c-bbc8-6c07208eeb3c",
    "lastName": "User",
    "superAdmin": true,
    "username": "admin@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Usage with Automation

For automation purposes, you can extract just the machine identity token from the response:

```bash
infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com --email=admin@example.com --password=your-secure-password --organization=your-org-name | jq ".identity.credentials.token"
```

This extracts only the token, which can be captured in a variable or piped to other commands.

## Example: Capture Token in a Variable

```bash
TOKEN=$(infisical bootstrap --domain=https://your-infisical-instance.com --email=admin@example.com --password=your-secure-password --organization=your-org-name | jq -r ".identity.credentials.token")

# Now use the token for further automation
echo "Token has been captured and can be used for authentication"
```

## Notes

- The bootstrap process can only be performed once on a fresh Infisical instance
- All flags are required for the bootstrap process to complete successfully
- Security controls prevent privilege escalation: instance admin identities cannot be managed by non-instance admin users and identities
- The generated admin user account can be used to log in via the UI if needed
