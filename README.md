**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their application configuration and secrets like API keys and database credentials as well as manage their internal PKI.

We're on a mission to make security tooling more accessible to everyone, not just security teams, and that means redesigning the entire developer experience from ground up.
